# Markdown-Quiz-to-JSON

Tosses a few RegEx and loops at a specifically formatted MarkDown file to spit out a JSON file so custom quiz software can be created easier.  Right now the only format it is comptable with is [lydiahallie/javascript-questions](https://github.com/lydiahallie/javascript-questions), a very popular list of advanced JavaScript questions.

## Instalition

Inside the parent folder where you locally downloaded `lydiahallie/javascript-questions`:
`git clone https://github.com/tomByrer/markdown-quiz-to-json`

## Use

### Instant

Save the pre-compiled [quiz.json](
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomByrer/markdown-quiz-to-json/master/quiz.json`) directly into your local folder to use!

The [quiz-random.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomByrer/markdown-quiz-to-json/master/quiz-random.json) adds more interests by changing out the monotonous "What's the output?" question with a few more interesting takes, reorders the answers & questions.

#### CDN

[jsDelivr OSS CDN]() can be used in frontend projects.  Here the `@1` flag means your app will automatically be updated for any v1.x changes, but not v2.  jsDeivr automataically applies GZip, so only 35k is sent over the wire.

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tombyrer/markdown-quiz-to-json@1/quiz.json
// if you want the pre-randomized file:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tombyrer/markdown-quiz-to-json@1/quiz-random.json
```

### Rebuild JSON

Have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed.  Inside `markdown-quiz-to-json` folder:
`node cli`
 A new 	`quiz.json` should be output.  If you want process another file, edit the `fs.readFileSync` filename.

The key-names should be self-explainitory.   Note that only 1 code example is allowed in the current API.  So you'll have to combine seperate 'files' (eg HTML & CSS) into 1 file.

If the source markdown has a [bad entry](https://github.com/lydiahallie/javascript-questions/pull/385), the RegEx will likely skip it, but still capture the ohter entries.

### In-app Randomness

If you want to help prevent cheating or boredom, you can re-random the questions and answers everytime the app is run.  Note: the `idx` field still refects the orginal order in the MarkDown.

Assuming `quiz.json` & `random.js` are in the root of your NodeJS project:

```js
const quizQuestions = require("./quis.json")
const random = require("./random")
random.entryInternals(quizQuestions)
random.shuffleOrder(quizQuestions)
// quizQuestions is mutated
```

## History

* v1.1 : optional randomize entry order, option order, and some question titles
* v1 : full length key names in JSON
* v0 : inital release

## TODO

* Give semi-correct answers a "exactness" rating between 0 & 1.
* Make into an API, likely with [Cloudflare WOrkers](https://github.com/tomByrer/awesome-cloudflare-workers).  But IMHO loading direct from
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomByrer/markdown-quiz-to-json/master/quiz.json`
should be fine with a small userbase.  Might configure to use [jsDelivr OSS CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) instead.
* Seperate answers from quiz; conceal/randomize possible-answer IDs
